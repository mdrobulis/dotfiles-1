# My dotfiles

Contained here are my configuration files for:

* vim
* tmux
* irssi
* zsh

I think they're pretty good (I love them!) and they took a long time for me
to get right.

## vim note

my vim configuration uses `vundle` exclusively - so you'll want that and
then run `:BundleInstall` to get going.
